The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

`0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21.........`

that is produced by the adding up two number appear before the sequence.

Write a MIPS assembly program that takes one number as an input, let say n
and print the first n number of Fibonacci series by first storing into the memory.

The output format (for n = 6) should be like this:

`1 number of fibonacci series is stored at memory location 3000`<br />
`2 number of fibonacci series is stored at memory location 3004`<br />
`3 number of fibonacci series is stored at memory location 3008`<br />
`.........`
