For a given arithmetic and geometric progression sequence:

1,11,21,31,........ (A.P.)
4, 8, 16,........(G.P.)

Write a MIPS assembly program to compute the eight-term (in A.P) / fourth term (in G.P.) and sum of the first six (in A.P) / first four numbers (in G.P.). Note that values of
the first term (a), the common difference/ratio (d/r), and the number of terms
(n) is stored in the registers or memory locations. Further, all the digits used in the formulae are immediately
provided in the instruction as an immediate value.
