# A example of sample MIPS instructions
# used to test QtSPIM
# Declare main as a global function
.globl main
# All program code is placed after the
# .text assembler directive


.text
# The label ’main’ represents the starting point
main:
li $t1, 25 # Load immediate value 
lw $t2, value # Load the word stored in value (see bottom)
add $t3, $t1, $t2 # Add
sw $t3, Z #Store the answer in Z (declared at the bottom)
# Exit the program by means of a syscall.
# There are many syscalls - pick the desired one
# by placing its code in $v0. The code for exit is "10"
li $v0, 10 # Sets $v0 to "10" to select exit syscall
syscall # Exit
# All memory structures are placed after the
# .data assembler directive
.data
# The .word assembler directive reserves space
# in memory for a single 4-byte word (or multiple 4-byte words)
# and assigns that memory location an initial value
# (or a comma separated list of initial values)
value: .word 10
Z: .word 0
